# Banksight-Project
BankSight is a lightweight analytics dashboard built with Python, SQL, and Streamlit, designed to explore and interpret banking transaction data. The goal of the project is to bring useful insights into how customers interact with their accounts and how transaction activity varies across different segments of a bank’s operations.
